# Project
This project represents the final project of the Robotics course held in the spring semester 2020 by the University of Southern Switzerland (USI). <br/><br/>

The goal of the project is to teach a robot (the Mighty Thymio, a personalized variant of the Thymio by IDSIA) not to crash against obstacles in an environment by using a convolutional neural network that given an image, predicts a steering angle for the robot that travels at constant speed.
